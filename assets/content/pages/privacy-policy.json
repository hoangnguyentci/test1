The information we must provide you with includes, our purpose, lawful basis, retention periods, who we intend to share it with and your rights.\nb.\tWe must provide this in plain English.\n2.\tRight to access\na.\tYou have the right to request access to the personal data that we process about you.\nb.\tWe must provide this __free of charge__. However, we can charge a \u2018reasonable fee\u2019 when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.\n3.\tRight to rectification\na.\tYou have a right to have inaccurate personal data rectified or completed if it is incomplete.\n4.\tRight to erasure\na.\tThis gives you the right to request that we erase your information from our systems under certain circumstances.\nb.\tThis is not an absolute right to have your data erased and can be a bit confusing, for example if you are a supplier of goods and services to us, we need to process your information so that we can pay you. You can read more about when this right applies [here](https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr\/individual-rights\/right-to-erasure\/).\nc.\tIf you have asked us to stop sending you marketing messages, in order to honour this request, we need to maintain a suppression file and we will do this under a legal obligation inline with data protection and PECR regulations \u2013 if we did not retain this suppression file, we may collect your data via another source and you may start getting marketing messages again.\nd.\tIf we do not believe that we need to comply with your request, we will explain why.\n5.\tRight to restrict processing\na.\tYou have the right to request the restriction or the suppression of your personal data, again it only applies in certain cases and is an alternative to the \u201cRight to erasure\u201d. You can read more about this right [here](https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr\/individual-rights\/right-to-restrict-processing\/).\n6.\tRight to data portability\na.\tThis right would be highly unlikely to apply to View My Chain and the data it holds about you. It would most likely apply in situations like switching banks and utility providers for instance. This right only applies where the following conditions have been met: -\ni.\tyou provided the personal data to the data controller (View My Chain)\nii.\twhere our lawful basis (see table above) is based on your consent or contract; and\niii.\tis processed by automated means.\n7.\tRight to object\na.\tYou have the right to object to: -\ni.\tProcessing which is based on legitimate interest, or the performance of a task in the public interest where there is no overriding justification for the processing of your data.\nii.\tDirect Marketing, including profiling.\niii.\tProcessing for purposes of scientific \/ historic research and statistics. \n8.\tRights related to automated decision making including profiling \na.\tYou have the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making which produces legal effects or significantly affects you. You also have the right to request human intervention, express your point of view or obtain an explanation of the decision and be able to challenge it.\nb.\tHowever, we do not use any automated decision-making processes which have a damaging effect on you. \n9.\tRight to complain to a supervisory authority\na.\tIf we have been unable to deal with your complaint to a satisfactory level, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO), you can contact them [here](https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/concerns\/). \n\n__Changes to our privacy policy__\nWe reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time as appropriate in relation to legislative or our business developments.
