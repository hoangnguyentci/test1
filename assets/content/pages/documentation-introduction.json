Here you'll find everything you need to integrate with the View My Chain API. We'll cover all the terms and journeys required for you to make the most of the API. We also have an [API reference](\/docs\/api\/index.html) for a granular look at all the available endpoints.\n\n### Specification ###\nOur API follows the [JSON API Specification](http:\/\/jsonapi.org\/) so all our endpoints return [JSON](http:\/\/json.org). It uses common HTTP verbs according to [REST](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Representational_state_transfer) and uses [HTTP Status Codes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) to indicate success or error. Our endpoints require HTTP Authentication.\n\n### Authentication ###\nView My Chain will generate your access token on your behalf and send it to you to use. In future we will be allowing users to generate access tokens from within the application. You will need to pass your access token within the headers of your request to our API.\n```\nAuthentication: Bearer <YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>\n```\n\n##### Scopes and Permissions #####\nAll access tokens inherit the permissions of the user attached to it; the role your user has is assigned by View My Chain during onboarding. For this reason our API does not currently use scopes to dictate what an API access token can and cannot do.\n\n### [Glossary](\/docs\/glossary) ###\nTo help you understand the terms a little more we have created a glossary of commonly used terms throughout our documentation.\n\n### [Data Structure](\/docs\/data-structure) ###\nTo help visualise the terms better, we have put together a diagram of how our data relates to each other, so hopefully you'll be able to map your own data structure to ours.\n\n### Tutorials ###\nTo help you get started we have created a number of tutorials to help you create and import data into View My Chain. We will focus on getting your data in View My Chain and the go on to explain how you can use the data once it's in.\n\n##### [Creating a Listing](\/docs\/creating-a-listing) #####\nWe'll look at how you can create a listing with some basic information and then go on to finding and filtering listings.\n\n##### [Milestones](\/docs\/milestones) #####\nOnce you have a listing, you can start adding and updating milestones against that listings. This tutorial will cover the basics of createing and updating milestones, and then take a look at validation, and the knock-on effects of creating certain milestones.\n\n##### [Chaining](\/docs\/chaining) #####\nNow you've got some listings in, you'll presumably want to start chaining your listings with others. We'll also cover unchaining listings and checking chains.\n\n##### [Additional Listing Actions](\/docs\/additional-listing-actions) #####\nThis will cover what additional actions can be achieved with a listing, such as making a listing available, and completing a listing.\n\n##### [Notes](\/docs\/notes) #####\nYou may wish to start taking notes about the progression of you listing, this guide will show you how, and how you get notes for a listing and tagging notes.\n\n##### [Milestone States](\/docs\/milestone-states) #####\nThis tutorial will explain what a milestone state is, what information it contains, and how it could be useful for you.","sectionClass":"standard--static","sectionType":"StandardSection","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2018-01-25T08:54:03.753Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-18T14:04:39.569Z","contentType":"section"}}],"pageTemplate":"default","slug":"documentation-introduction","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2018-01-25T08:54:31.853Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-26T12:17:56.224Z","contentType":"page"}}
