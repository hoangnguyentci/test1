May has been a strong month but we expect early summer to be slow (over the holiday period) with  the second part of Q3 and early Q4 to be strong and not dissimilar to 2017.\u201d\n\n__What are the benefits of using View My Chain? And How does using View My Chain support your efforts?__  He replied \u201cWe have championed View My Chain and understood from the outset the benefits of transparency.  Chain breaks are a powerful tool and we have benefited from improvements and efficiencies to our organisation.  We have always been process-driven, so using View My Chain makes sense, it makes things clearer.  Being able to effectively record conversations, date stamps on notes, it\u2019s being diligent.\u201d \n\n__Another View My Chain customer, Mitul, Managing Director and owner of multiple Whitegates franchise offices across Leicester said:__\n\u201cSome believe the property market is booming and some it is in decline. This mixed messaging centres around the now very boring subject of Brexit and with no agreed or structured exit, this is causing uncertainty in the economy as a whole and, for some, decisions around moving are placed on hold.\u201d\n\u201cThere are pockets in many areas where property is booming. Good schools, thriving communities with a range of amenities helps these areas\u2019 house prices to steadily grow and keep demand strong, so much so that they seem largely unaffected by the macroeconomic effects. An example of this is the Charnwood area of Leicestershire where we have seen an average of 6% annual increase in prices due to strong demand.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to Land Registry figures, property owners have benefited from an average annual price rise of 3.9%, which makes the average property in the UK valued at \u00a3226,906.\nWith the shortage of housing in the UK, demand for property remains strong and despite attempts by developers to build more, supply is not matching demand and we all know what this generally means. With interest rates being low, I believe regardless of talks of a potential small rate increase or uncertainty of Brexit. The British people will continue to pursue their dreams of home ownership and property investment as this is part of our culture. Transactions are taking longer which sometimes distort some numbers but overall for the year, it should still be a strong year for property with steady rises in certain parts of the UK.\u201d\n\nMitul\u2019s whitegates have recently centralised sales progression, a growing trend in the sector as agents are looking to be more efficient businesses and they have adopted View My Chain as the tool of choice or their centralised sales progression team.\n\n__Mark Vosper, Managing Partner of  Michael Anthony estate agents in Aylesbury said:__\n\u201cIn the current climate we are finding there are plenty of instructions coming to market, the key is dealing with the vendors who are serious about selling and that are realistic in their expectations of the current market. By working with motivated vendors who listen to our advice, we are achieving a good level of agreed sales and concentrating on the clients that are actually focussed on moving.\u201d\n\n__How will View My Chain help you in 2018?__ \n\u201cWe are very happy with the service that View My Chain provides, this product is now embedded across the business.  We use it to at market appraisals to help us win new instructions.  Our staff like using the tool as it\u2019s simple to use and better than other sales progressions systems they have seen. We back the concept and very much feel that View My Chain care about the success of this branch which is a really big positive.\u201d\n\nSohail Rashid, Founder and CEO of View My Chain comments \u201cMarket conditions for the residential property sector this year have been tough and this will not only test the business models of many estate agents but also many proptech estate agency suppliers.  We are focussed on working with agents to help them not only survive but grow and become stronger operationally during this period.  We are delighted that the growing feedback from our customer base is that our sales progression tool is a superior product to anything else in the market and that it is so effective that agents are able to use it to win new instructions over slower adopters in their local markets.\u201d\n","newsThumbnailImage":"\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/019o4x34ndl7\/7I8eFwBRYcaICaOomOm4ei\/039c9fb63a08fec69ae68727854d46d2\/Pay-quicker-blog.jpeg","newsImage":"\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/019o4x34ndl7\/4hBMQGxMFaAu4CI28wUIaU\/44d9e5687d883b32854e509c229223c3\/IMG_0021_compressed.jpg","category":{"categoryTitle":"Press Release","categorySlug":"press-release","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2017-07-05T15:13:40.240Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-05T15:13:40.240Z","contentType":"category"}},"modelType":"Post","author":{"authorName":"Sohail Rashid","authorAvatar":"\/\/images.ctfassets.net\/019o4x34ndl7\/6rwyoMcBH2M2EsSUeU6KiW\/c5aaa2b07d071589be7d581fac87e3d3\/Sohail-Rashid-Lrg-Web.jpg","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2017-08-01T02:27:19.689Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-05T02:38:11.287Z","contentType":"author"}},"sectionType":"NewsPost","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2018-06-29T09:34:53.503Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-29T10:07:21.062Z","contentType":"news"}},"blockClass":"feature-post feature-news","sectionType":"FeatureNewsSection","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2017-07-13T03:49:47.728Z","updatedAt":"2018-06-29T09:38:18.864Z","contentType":"blockFeatureNews"}},{"blockEntryTitle":"News Listing Block","postContentType":"news","blockClass":"news-listing","sectionType":"PostsSection","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2017-07-13T03:39:48.426Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-13T03:39:48.426Z","contentType":"blockPosts"}}],"pageTemplate":"news-listing","slug":"news","sysMeta":{"createdAt":"2017-07-13T03:57:55.107Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-05T09:13:55.364Z","contentType":"page"}}
